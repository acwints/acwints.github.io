		<h1>Admirable Leader</h1>
		<h4><em>May 20th, 2020</em></h4>
		<br>
		<p>
			One leader who I greatly admire is Phil Jackson, former NBA player and coach, whose career showcases a legacy of winning unlike any other. Phil won 2 NBA championships as a player on the New York Knicks and an incredible 11 championships as the coach of the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. Aside from his objective success as a world champion, Phil has always struck me as someone who possesses a great deal of wisdom and forethought.
		</p>
		<p>
			On camera, Phil always seemed to act good-humored, mild-mannered and particularly thoughtful. I’ve been reminded of these traits over the past few weeks while watching The Last Dance on ESPN, a documentary about Michael Jordan, where Phil is placed at the center of some of the most intense and competitive drama in sports but almost always finds a way to stay calm. It’s said that coaching, in basketball in particular, is primarily a job where you’re forced to manage personalities and align incentives in such a fashion that the entire team can stay focused on a singular outcome, winning. To think that Phil coached superstars the likes of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, and was able to coordinate their efforts at all, let alone in pursuit of 11 championship rings, is a remarkable feat.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, while not quite as pronounced, I’ve come to realize that all leadership and management, whether it’s of a sports team, a company, a government, etc., essentially comes down to the alignment of individual and group incentives. By elegantly creating positive-sum environments and fostering collaboration atop a foundation of discipline and drive, Phil Jackson defined what it means to be a strong leader.
