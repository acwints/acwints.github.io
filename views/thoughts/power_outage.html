		<h1>Power Outage</h1>
		<h4><em>August 4th, 2020</em></h4>
		<p>
			Hurricane Isasis hit the East Coast today. As far as I know, there hasn't been any significant damage to my town or the surrounding area, but it was certainly one of the more powerful storms I've witnesseed in recent memory. I'm stationed at my parents' home in Darien, CT, where the wind gusts approached 60mph and tree branches now cover the ground. I actually even watched as a tree was uprooted and fell on to our garage, fortunately steering clear of the main house. We maintained power throughout most of the day, but as I write this it's approaching 10pm and we haven't had power since 6pm.

			Across the globe, Beirut was subject to an explosion this morning the likes of which I've only seen in footage of nuclear-esq bombings. There was even a seismic wave visible in the video from Beirut, after which hundreds of civilians have been reported dead with hundreds more missing. At the moment it appears the incident has been credited to an accident relating to firework-type materials at the facility where the explosion took place, but in some ways it almost makes me more nervous to think that can happen in such an innocent manner.
		</p>

			Regardless, I can't help but ponder the discrepancy between a power outage in the United States and a major explosion in the Middle East. The power outage we're experiencing here is simply the result of Mother Nature and a legitimate hurricane, which thankfully was telegraphed over the past week on radar. On the other hand, the explosion in Beirut happened in seconds, with only a slight trail of smoke in the preceding minutes to hint that something might be wrong. I don't mean to underestimate Mother Nature, as she too is very capable of immediate action. Rather, I still find it remarkable how swiftly man has ascended to that same level of power, without any real grasp on the threat we pose to ourselves.

			As I sit here now in the dark, I am pleasantly reminded of our humble nature. The fact that I'm still able to type on a computer is a testament to our ingenuity, but I appreciate the fact that our WiFi is out so that I can remember what it's like to be shut out from the rest of the world. My iPhone has one bar, so I've been able to send out a couple of text messages but it's not sufficient to access social media or the rest of the internet. It also reminds me that so much of my daily interactions with the internet are not actually necessary and can easily be opted out of. I don't have to check me email multiple times per day. I don't have to scroll Twitter or Instagram just because I'm bored. I'm not missing out on anything important. A power outage is like a breath of fresh air, reminding you to wake up and think for yourself. On a related note, I wonder if it's possible to start promoting the tracking of 'Internet Time' as opposed to 'Screen Time', as I'm starting to believe more and more that screens themselves are not inherently evil, but unplugging from the internet brain is absolutely critical to a sane and productive existence.

			tl;dr - Power outages are a gift to be cherished and a prescient reminder of our insignificance
